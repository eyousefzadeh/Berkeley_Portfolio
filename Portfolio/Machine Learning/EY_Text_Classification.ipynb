    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

    "After reviewing the text of the value with the highest R-values, I noticed a couple of errors. The top 2 values are incorrectly misclassifying the text as comp.graphics where in fact it should be talk.religion. I believe this is due to a couple of reasons. First, the word \"ftp\" is used frequently in these two examples and I would think ftp is highly correlated with the graphics section. Second, even though the word Mormon should be significantly correlated with religion, it is not, this can be due to the fact that the Mormon religion is rather small and does not get enough mentions in the training data set for religion. One way to address this problem is to artificially or manually increate the weights for \"ftp\" and \"Mormon\". "

    "After noticing an underserved weighting for the word \"Mormon\", I decided to create a list of words (one in this case) to add to each training data that is labeled in the 'religion' category. What this does is it artificially increases the coefficient weighting to the word \"Mormon\". When rerunning it against the dev data, it immediately recognizes the high weighting of the word \"Mormon\" and the R value is significantly reduced. Although it still didn't correctly classify the data as \"religion\", it is still a major improvement in reducing the R values for these two examples. "
